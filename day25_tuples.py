#tuples are very similar to list ...only single item tuple is different
# tuples cannot be edited they are like strings immutable
# tuples are read only document
# we can use in solutions jha data ka integration jsa hai waisa rhega ...

#create
t1=() #empty tuple
t2=(1,2,3,4) #homogeneous tuple
t3 = ("hello", 1 , 2 ) #heterogeneous touple
t4 =(1) #it is not a tuple.it is integer....
t5=(1,) #single item tuple
t6 =tuple("goa")
