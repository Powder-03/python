# everything in python is a object ...and every object belongs to a class
#in python u can assume that datatype is a class.. aur us data type ka jab variable bnate toh wo hota hai object of that class
#from now on variables and objects are same
#CLASS - class is a blue print of how an object will behave 

#there are two important things of class ..it either have data or property .... and functions and behaviour


#class basic structure
class Car:
    color="blue" #data
    model="sports" #data
    def calculateAvgSpeed (km , time): #method
        #some code
        print("some")
 
#generally the data is private and methods are public ....methods are denoted by + .



#class ka name should be in pascal case ---- ThisIsPascalCase
#snake_case --- variables and data ka naam snake case me

#for built in class we use object literals

#funtions vs methods  

#method is a special function which is written inside a class
#another difference is calling them
#jab method pass karte toh



# we can say data type is a class and variable is an object of that class
